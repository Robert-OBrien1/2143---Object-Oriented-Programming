## Definitions

### Abstraction
> A simplified version of something technical, such as a function or an object in a program.

### Attributes / Properties
> A specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such.

### Class

> A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

### Class Variable
> A class variable is any variable declared with the static modifier of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist.

### Compositino
> A way to combine objects or data types into more complex ones.

### Encapsulation
>  Refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.

### Friends
> A class in that can access the private and protected members of the class in which it is declared

### Inheritance
> The mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes from existing ones such as super class or base class and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes.

### Instance Variable
> A variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance.

### Member Variable
> A variable that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its methods (member functions).

### Method
>  A procedure associated with a message and an object.

### Multiple Inheritance
> When an object or class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent object or parent class.

### Object
> A variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a value in memory referenced by an identifier.

### Overloading 
> Refers to a set of processes in computer programming by which one special word or symbol may be given multiple meanings.

### Polymorphism
> The provision of a single interface to entities of different types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types.

### Public / Private / Protected
> A public member is accessible from anywhere outside the class but within a program. You can set and get the value of public variables without any member. A private member variable or function cannot be accessed, or even viewed from outside the class. Only the class and friend functions can access private members. Protected methods are a balance between public and private methods. They are similar to private methods in that they cannot be accessed in the public scope. Neither the client nor the program can invoke them.

### Virtual
> A virtual function or virtual method is an inheritable and overridable function or method for which dynamic dispatch is facilitated.
